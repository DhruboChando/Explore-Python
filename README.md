This repository documents my journey of learning Python programming. It contains practice exercises, projects, and notes that cover Python fundamentals as well as intermediate and advanced concepts. The focus is on building a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and applying Python to real-world scenarios, including:

Core syntax and data structures

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

File handling and exception management

Modules, packages, and virtual environments

Working with APIs and databases

Basics of data analysis and visualization

Introduction to machine learning libraries

The goal of this repo is to track progress, improve coding skills, and serve as a reference for future projects.
